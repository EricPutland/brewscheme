It's been a long time coming, but the version 1.0.0 release of `brewscheme` is now available.  The package should be available from the SSC archives in the not too distant future as well, but for now you can install the stable release using:

```Stata
net inst brewscheme, from("https://wbuchanan.github.io/brewscheme/") replace
```

In addition to taking care of known bugs, the stable release also includes much more comprehensive documentation (particularly for `brewtheme`).  I'll also be submitting an article to the StataJournal in the next few days.  As always, if you run into any bugs/issues please [submit an issue](https://github.com/wbuchanan/brewscheme/issues).  Additionally, if you find the program useful, feel free to share the code you use to generate scheme files and they can be included in the project Wiki to give others access to a starting point for customizing scheme files for themselves a bit easier.
