`brewscheme` now includes new Mata classes/methods to simulate the color that would be perceived by individuals with varying types of color sightedness impairments.  Additionally, similar to [brewviewer](https://wbuchanan.github.io/brewscheme/brewviewer) there is also an analogous program available to show how the simulated color values would appear called [brewcbview](https://wbuchanan.github.io/brewscheme/brewcbview).  Future development will exapand the options of both brewcbview (e.g., to handle multiple color tuples and display them in a single graph), brewviewer (e.g., to show a preview of specific palette combinations under varying forms of color sightedness impairment), to add the simulated colors to lookup tables used by [brewscheme](https://wbuchanan.github.io/brewscheme/brewscheme) and [brewtheme](https://wbuchanan.github.io/brewscheme/brewtheme), and to create a proofer for Stata graphs that would show how they would appear under different forms of color sight impairment.  

As always, comments, requests, and collaborators are always welcome.
