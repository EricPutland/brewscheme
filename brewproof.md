This prefix command is used to generate a series of replicas of the specified graph that simulate the appearance of the graph to individuals with varying forms of color sight impairments.  The program has received limited testing thus far, but appears to work in limited settings.  

## Notes 
**This prefix will not work with StataCorp or thirdparty generated scheme files.**  Due to the way other scheme files are specified, this program is designed to integrate only with scheme files generated by the current version of brewscheme/brewtheme.  While masked from the user, a call to brewscheme/brewtheme now generates several scheme files that include schemes used to simulate these types of color sight impairment.  This allows the prefix to then call the same graph command multiple times with each version of the scheme file to provide consistent side by side comparisons.

# Examples
This example builds on the graph created in the example on the [brewtheme](https://wbuchanan.github.io/brewscheme/brewtheme/) page.

```
brewproof, scheme(ggtest2) : tw lowess mpg weight             ||     ///   
                             scatter mpg weight if rep78 == 1 ||     ///   
                             scatter mpg weight if rep78 == 2 ||     ///   
                             scatter mpg weight if rep78 == 3 ||     ///   
                             scatter mpg weight if rep78 == 4 ||     ///   
                             scatter mpg weight if rep78 == 5,       ///   
                             legend(order(2 "1978 Repair Record = 1" ///   
                             3 "1978 Repair Record = 2"              ///   
                             4 "1978 Repair Record = 3"              ///   
                             5 "1978 Repair Record = 4"              ///   
                             6 "1978 Repair Record = 5")) 
```
