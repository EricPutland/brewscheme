d 'BREWSCHEME': a program for generating customized graph scheme files
d
d brewscheme is a program to facilitate Stata users developing graph schemes    
d using research-based color palettes.  Unlike other uses of the color 		   
d palettes developed by Brewer, this program allows users to specify the number 
d of colors from any of the 35 color palettes they would like to use and allows 
d users to mix/combine different palettes for the various graph types.  
d Additionally, the program also contains color palettes from other researchers 
d as well as color palettes commonly used in graphs in the education community.
d The newest version also includes a submodule to preview combinations of color
d palettes, a Hexadecimal to Decimal RGB converter, and a Java-based program to
d interpolate a given number of colors between a starting and ending color.
