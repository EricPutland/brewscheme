**brewscheme** is a Stata utility for the creation of data visualizations.  The package includes tools for conversions 
between colorspaces, color interpolation, setting global graph aesthetics, setting plot type aesthetics and previewing 
color palette combinations.  Most importantly for Stata users, this program saves *you* time.  Rather than constantly 
needing to pass arguments to aesthetic parameters, you can create a theme and/or scheme file to store these settings.  Then, 
you only need to pass `scheme(myschemeFileName)` to the command to get all of your aesthetic settings back.
